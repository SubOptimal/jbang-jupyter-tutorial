# jbang-jupyter-tutorial

Jupyter notebook based tutorial for getting started with Java using jbang.

Tested to work in vscode and vscodium locally and in following browser based environments directly:

- [GitPod.io](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/jbangdev/jbang-jupyter-tutorial/)
- [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/jbangdev/jbang-jupyter-tutorial/codespaces) 
- [OpenShift Workspaces](https://workspaces.openshift.com/?url=https://github.com/jbangdev/jbang-jupyter-tutorial/)

Also tested to work with plain Jupyter Notebook in [Red Hat OpenShift Data Science](https://developers.redhat.com/products/red-hat-openshift-data-science/overview) sandbox.

## Work in progress

I recently realized Jupyter Notebooks works well as a tutorial format with `jbang`. Made this very quickly to test it out.

Will see where it goes!

Suggestions and PR's very welcome :)
